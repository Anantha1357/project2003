    The term "health" refers to the body's natural and healthy state. Hygiene refers to healthy habits that help to prevent sickness and maintain excellent health.
    Approximately 90% of office mugs contain germs and bacteria that can get you sick. So make sure to wash your utensils before using them.
    Did you know that the germs and other particles released by sneezing can travel up to 130 kilometres per hour? Always remember to cover your sneeze.
    A balanced and nutritious diet is a prerequisite for good health. Fruits and vegetables have vital minerals and vitamins which we need. We must wash fruits and cook vegetables before consumption.
    Hygiene refers to conditions and practises that help to maintain health and prevent the spread of diseases..</p> <br>
